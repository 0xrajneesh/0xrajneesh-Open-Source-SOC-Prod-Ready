# Duplicate Alert Suppression

## Objective

Prevent repeated Graylog events from generating duplicate notifications or tickets.

## Graylog Event Condition

```text
Any noisy event type suitable for deduplication
```

## n8n Nodes

1. Webhook
2. Create fingerprint
3. Data Store / DB lookup
4. IF — fingerprint exists
5. Update counter or create record
6. Notify only first occurrence

## Workflow

```text
Graylog Event
     ↓
   Webhook
     ↓
Create Fingerprint
     ↓
Seen Recently?
  ┌──┴──┐
 Yes    No
  ↓      ↓
Update   Create Record
Count       ↓
  ↓      Notify/Ticket
 End
```

## Configuration Steps

1. Build a fingerprint using fields such as event type, host, user, source IP, and rule ID.
2. Check a persistent store for the fingerprint.
3. If seen recently, increment a counter and suppress the duplicate action.
4. If new, create the record and send the ticket/notification.
5. Expire fingerprints after a defined suppression window.

## Example Incoming Payload

Use this only as a conceptual example. Inspect the real payload Graylog sends to your n8n webhook.

```json
{
  "event": {
    "id": "EVENT-ID",
    "event_definition_id": "DEFINITION-ID",
    "timestamp": "2026-08-10T18:30:00Z",
    "message": "Security event detected",
    "source": "graylog",
    "priority": 4
  },
  "backlog": [
    {
      "source": "host-01",
      "message": "Original event message",
      "src_ip": "203.0.113.10",
      "username": "user1"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Recommended n8n Normalization

Create an **Edit Fields / Set** node immediately after the Webhook and normalize the fields your workflow needs.

Example expressions:

```text
event_id:
{{ $json.body?.event?.id || $json.event?.id }}

event_title:
{{ $json.body?.event?.message || $json.event?.message }}

priority:
{{ $json.body?.event?.priority || $json.event?.priority }}

source:
{{ $json.body?.backlog?.[0]?.source || $json.backlog?.[0]?.source }}

src_ip:
{{ $json.body?.backlog?.[0]?.src_ip || $json.backlog?.[0]?.src_ip }}
```

Adjust these expressions to match your actual Graylog HTTP notification payload.

## Safety / Production Controls

For any workflow that changes infrastructure, identity, endpoint state, firewall policy, or user access:

```text
Detection
   ↓
Validation
   ↓
Enrichment
   ↓
Policy Check
   ↓
Human Approval
   ↓
Response Action
   ↓
Verification
   ↓
Audit Record
```

Recommended controls:

- Never take destructive action from a single unvalidated log message.
- Maintain allowlists for critical assets, administrators, scanners, and service accounts.
- Use dedicated API identities with least privilege.
- Store API keys in n8n Credentials.
- Add timeouts and error handling to all external API calls.
- Record the original Graylog event ID in every ticket/action.
- Require analyst approval for containment in production unless the use case is explicitly pre-authorized.

## Graylog Trigger Setup

Attach an **HTTP Notification** to the relevant Graylog Event Definition.

Example n8n production webhook:

```text
http://10.46.96.12:5678/webhook/graylog-event
```

For production, prefer:

```text
https://n8n.example.com/webhook/graylog-event
```
