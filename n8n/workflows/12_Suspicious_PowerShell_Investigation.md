# Suspicious PowerShell Investigation

## Objective

Collect contextual information when Graylog detects suspicious PowerShell execution.

## Graylog Event Condition

```text
PowerShell event matching suspicious command-line patterns
```

## n8n Nodes

1. Webhook
2. Extract host/user/command
3. HTTP Request — Wazuh or EDR API
4. Enrich parent process
5. IF — suspicious context
6. Ticket
7. Notify

## Workflow

```text
Graylog PowerShell Event
          ↓
        Webhook
          ↓
 Host + User + Command
          ↓
 Endpoint Context Lookup
          ↓
 Parent/Process Enrichment
          ↓
      Risk Decision
          ↓
      Ticket / Notify
```

## Configuration Steps

1. Trigger from parsed PowerShell or Sysmon events in Graylog.
2. Extract hostname, username, process, parent process, and command line.
3. Query your endpoint platform for additional recent activity.
4. Build an investigation summary.
5. Create a ticket for events that remain suspicious after enrichment.
6. Include the original command line in a controlled field.

## Example Incoming Payload

Use this only as a conceptual example. Inspect the real payload Graylog sends to your n8n webhook.

```json
{
  "event": {
    "id": "EVENT-ID",
    "event_definition_id": "DEFINITION-ID",
    "timestamp": "2026-08-10T18:30:00Z",
    "message": "Security event detected",
    "source": "graylog",
    "priority": 4
  },
  "backlog": [
    {
      "source": "host-01",
      "message": "Original event message",
      "src_ip": "203.0.113.10",
      "username": "user1"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Recommended n8n Normalization

Create an **Edit Fields / Set** node immediately after the Webhook and normalize the fields your workflow needs.

Example expressions:

```text
event_id:
{{ $json.body?.event?.id || $json.event?.id }}

event_title:
{{ $json.body?.event?.message || $json.event?.message }}

priority:
{{ $json.body?.event?.priority || $json.event?.priority }}

source:
{{ $json.body?.backlog?.[0]?.source || $json.backlog?.[0]?.source }}

src_ip:
{{ $json.body?.backlog?.[0]?.src_ip || $json.backlog?.[0]?.src_ip }}
```

Adjust these expressions to match your actual Graylog HTTP notification payload.

## Safety / Production Controls

For any workflow that changes infrastructure, identity, endpoint state, firewall policy, or user access:

```text
Detection
   ↓
Validation
   ↓
Enrichment
   ↓
Policy Check
   ↓
Human Approval
   ↓
Response Action
   ↓
Verification
   ↓
Audit Record
```

Recommended controls:

- Never take destructive action from a single unvalidated log message.
- Maintain allowlists for critical assets, administrators, scanners, and service accounts.
- Use dedicated API identities with least privilege.
- Store API keys in n8n Credentials.
- Add timeouts and error handling to all external API calls.
- Record the original Graylog event ID in every ticket/action.
- Require analyst approval for containment in production unless the use case is explicitly pre-authorized.

## Graylog Trigger Setup

Attach an **HTTP Notification** to the relevant Graylog Event Definition.

Example n8n production webhook:

```text
http://10.46.96.12:5678/webhook/graylog-event
```

For production, prefer:

```text
https://n8n.example.com/webhook/graylog-event
```
