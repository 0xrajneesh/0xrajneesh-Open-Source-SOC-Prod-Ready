# Brute Force Login Response

## Objective

Enrich and escalate repeated authentication failures detected by Graylog.

## Graylog Event Condition

```text
Multiple failed logins from the same source IP or against the same account
```

## n8n Nodes

1. Webhook
2. Normalize Event
3. HTTP Request — IP reputation
4. IF — malicious/suspicious IP
5. Create Ticket
6. Notify SOC

## Workflow

```text
Graylog Brute Force Event
          ↓
        Webhook
          ↓
      Extract src_ip
          ↓
    IP Reputation Lookup
          ↓
   Suspicious Reputation?
      ┌────┴────┐
     Yes        No
      ↓          ↓
 Create Ticket  Notify Only
      ↓
 Escalate SOC
```

## Configuration Steps

1. Create a Graylog aggregation event counting failed logins over a short time window.
2. Send the event to n8n using HTTP notification.
3. Extract the attacker IP and username.
4. Query an IP reputation service using HTTP Request.
5. Create an incident when the reputation or attempt count exceeds your threshold.
6. Include the attempt count, username, source IP, and Graylog event link in the ticket.

## Example Incoming Payload

Use this only as a conceptual example. Inspect the real payload Graylog sends to your n8n webhook.

```json
{
  "event": {
    "id": "EVENT-ID",
    "event_definition_id": "DEFINITION-ID",
    "timestamp": "2026-08-10T18:30:00Z",
    "message": "Security event detected",
    "source": "graylog",
    "priority": 4
  },
  "backlog": [
    {
      "source": "host-01",
      "message": "Original event message",
      "src_ip": "203.0.113.10",
      "username": "user1"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Recommended n8n Normalization

Create an **Edit Fields / Set** node immediately after the Webhook and normalize the fields your workflow needs.

Example expressions:

```text
event_id:
{{ $json.body?.event?.id || $json.event?.id }}

event_title:
{{ $json.body?.event?.message || $json.event?.message }}

priority:
{{ $json.body?.event?.priority || $json.event?.priority }}

source:
{{ $json.body?.backlog?.[0]?.source || $json.backlog?.[0]?.source }}

src_ip:
{{ $json.body?.backlog?.[0]?.src_ip || $json.backlog?.[0]?.src_ip }}
```

Adjust these expressions to match your actual Graylog HTTP notification payload.

## Safety / Production Controls

For any workflow that changes infrastructure, identity, endpoint state, firewall policy, or user access:

```text
Detection
   ↓
Validation
   ↓
Enrichment
   ↓
Policy Check
   ↓
Human Approval
   ↓
Response Action
   ↓
Verification
   ↓
Audit Record
```

Recommended controls:

- Never take destructive action from a single unvalidated log message.
- Maintain allowlists for critical assets, administrators, scanners, and service accounts.
- Use dedicated API identities with least privilege.
- Store API keys in n8n Credentials.
- Add timeouts and error handling to all external API calls.
- Record the original Graylog event ID in every ticket/action.
- Require analyst approval for containment in production unless the use case is explicitly pre-authorized.

## Graylog Trigger Setup

Attach an **HTTP Notification** to the relevant Graylog Event Definition.

Example n8n production webhook:

```text
http://10.46.96.12:5678/webhook/graylog-event
```

For production, prefer:

```text
https://n8n.example.com/webhook/graylog-event
```
